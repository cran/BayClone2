Depends: R (>= 2.0.1), combinat
Description: The package implements a Bayesian feature allocation model for inference on tumor heterogeneity using next-generation sequencing data. The model identifies the subclonal copy number and single nucleotide mutations at a selected set of loci and provides inference on genetic tumor variation.
